The dataset is divided into batches of 20 rows to optimize API usage efficiency. Each batch generates a comprehensive prompt directing Gemini to perform sentiment analysis (fatigue, activity, and mental health) using 1-5 rating scales with explicit criteria, returning results in JSON format. The system handles responses by extracting and validating JSON data, including error handling for API interactions and response parsing. Extracted sentiment scores are merged with the original dataset and visualized through summary statistics and distribution charts, enabling efficient analysis of textual health data while maintaining structured, machine-readable outputs for downstream applications."
